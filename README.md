In this game, any number of asterisks must be removed from a row, but only one row per turn. The player removes the last asterisk loses. You will play against an intelligent agent.

1. In this simple GitHub Repository, I uploaded 1 file "Nim_Game.py", containing the source code of our game.
2. You don't need anything special to run the program.
